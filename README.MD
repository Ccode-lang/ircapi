# IRC API
An api for python to make IRC bots.  

For an example of how to use it look at `test.py`  

If you want to ask some questions about how to use I have an IRC up at `hangoutirc.mooo.com/6697` (all messages are logged so I will see them, if the bot does not join your channel wait for 1 min and it should join to log the messages)
